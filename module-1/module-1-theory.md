# Module 1 - Theory

**Ohms Law**

V = I * R

Current = I = Amps

Voltage = V = Volts

Resistance = Î© = Ohms

**Power Triangle**

P = V * I

Power = P = Watts

Voltage = V = Volts

Current = I = Amps


# Single Phase Incoming Power Supply (up to 100A)

1. Distrobuters Cut Out (80A or 100A)
2. Electricity Meter
3. Meter Tails
4. Electicity Isolator Switch
5. Optiona seperate RCD for solar etc


**Distrobutors Cut Out**

    BS88
    Has tamper proof seal (Do not remove)

**Electricity meter**

    Also has tamper proof seal (Do not remove)

**Meter Tails**

    25mm squared CSA conductors between meter and consumer unit.

**Electricity Isolator Switch**

    Used to isolate electricity supply


# Fault Protection

A consumer unit must be able to handle:

    - Overcurrent Conditions

    - Earth Leakage Current Conditions

**Overcurrent**

    BS7671 Definition:
    A current exceeding the rated value. For conductors the rated value is the current carrying capacity.

    Overcurrent is subdevided into:

        - Overload Current
            BS7671 Definition:
            An overcurrent occuring in a circuit which is electrically sound.

        - Fault Current
            BS7671 Definition:
            A current resulting from a fault.

**Earth Leakage Current**

BS7671 Definition:
Electric current appeaaring in a protective conductor such as leaking current or electric current resulting from an insulation fault.

**Fault Current**

BS7671 Definition:
An overcurrent resulting from a fault of negledgable inpeedance between live conductors haveing a difference in potential under normal operating conditions.

# Isolator Switches 

Double pole isolator switches 

In consumer unit 1 manually operated and 1 encorporating an RCD

RCD protects against fault currents.
